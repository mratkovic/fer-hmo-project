FER Heuristic Optimization Methods (72561)  course 16/17 project



##  Problem
Power efficient virtual network functions placement - solution using generational genetic algorithm with additional local search of reduced neighborhood implemented in programming language Java.


Details of the problem can be found in `upute_za_projekt_iz_hmo_2016.pdf` written in Croatian.

Package `hr.fer.hmo.checker` contains modified course provided constraints checker and total cost calculator, package `hr.fer.zemris.optjava` implementation of genetic algorithm. Runner can be found in `hr.fer.hmo.demo.GARunner`.
